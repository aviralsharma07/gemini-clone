## Configuration

Before running the project, you'll need to generate your own Gemini API key and add it to the `gemini.js` file located in the `config` folder. You can generate the API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat?utm_source=agd&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=core-cta&utm_content=). Replace `API_KEY` with your generated API key in the `gemini.js` file.
